# Data-Analysis-Project
In this repository, I showcase my Data Analysis skills through a project on FC Barcelona player statistics. I chose this dataset because effective analytics is not only about technical tools but also about truly understanding the data and its context. My process began with cleaning and preparing the raw dataset, then exploring and analyzing it to extract meaningful statistics. I applied visualizations to highlight patterns and trends, and finally shared insights that could support decision-making. While this project is not at the highest level, my goal was to demonstrate my ability to approach data thoughtfully—understanding requirements, analyzing effectively, and transforming raw information into clear, actionable insights. This reflects the essence of data analysis: no matter the field, the core remains the same—understand the data, analyze it well, and produce valuable knowledge that drives improvement.
