# Data-Analysis-Project
In this repository, I demonstrate my Data Analysis skills using FC Barcelona player statistics. I cleaned and prepared the dataset, analyzed it, created visualizations, and shared insights. While not a high-level project, it highlights my ability to work with data clearly and effectively without overcomplicating.
